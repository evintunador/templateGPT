# templateGPT
## about
**this repo is currently undergoing a re-factoring. it'll likely be functional again in a week or two**

This is the model I edit whenever I want to test a new transformer architecture idea I have. It's designed to be:
- flexible in that many large changes are tweakable from the config file rather than messing with the code
- easy to read/edit the code since files are cleanly organized & well commented
- well suited for training models in the 1-10m parameter range on a CPU or the 100m-1b parameter range on a GPU without editing any code, just the config file
- easy to visualize/demonstrate what's happening in the progression of tensor shapes for learning & debugging purposes (thanks to our custom `LoggingModule.py` and `test_modules.ipynb`)
- almost as efficient as Andrej Karpathy's [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) despite everything we've added
- up to date with the most recent SotA architecture, namely Llama 3 (Karpathy's nanoGPT is based on the very old GPT2)

Notice that even though some of these models are very small (1 to 10m parameters), they are actually reasonable rough proxies for how well a scaled up version may do on real data thanks to our use of the [TinyStories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07759) dataset. According to the original paper, somewhere in the 1 to 3m parameter range a GPT2-inspired architecture is capable of understanding that the token 'apple' is something that the main character of the tiny story 'Tim' would like to 'eat'; meaning it can actually pick up on the relationships in this text which are an isomorphic subset of the ones that a larger language model would see when training on the entire internet. This basic idea is the backbone behind microsoft's Phi family of models, originally described in the paper [Textbooks Are All You Need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.11644), and how they can perform so well despite being so small. I hope this repo can be of help to anyone who wants to get into designing & building novel architectures but doesn't have the compute to test a larger model on every single idea they have. I'm literally training the 1-5m parameter models on the CPU of a 2019 iMac with 8gb of ram.

Then when it's time to scale up (50m-1b parameters) and use a GPU, all you have to do is go into the config file and switch to the [fineweb](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb) or [fineweb-edu](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu). Realistically single old GPUs are cheap enough nowadays (less than $1 per hour) that you could train the 1-5m parameter models on them for cheap and that's what I usually do, but it's still nice to think that someone who's resource constrained can mess around without having to learn how to use & pay for a GPU cloud solution at all, or that someone with a halfway decent CPU/GPU/MPS might find it easier to test locally before switching to a cloud GPU node.

This repo is part of a larger project of mine called [micro-GPT-sandbox](https://github.com/evintunador/micro-GPT-sandbox) that's basically a hub for all the novel model experiments I do, with the goal of facilitating easy comparison between the different models. Basically for each of those experiments I just use this very repo as a template to start editing, and then once I'm happy with the project (or if I've just abandoned it but it's moderately functional) I add it to the sandbox. If you end up using this repo as a template, feel free to contribute your project to the sandbox as well!

## getting started
1. clone the repository
2. `cd` to the folder
3. setup a virtual environment unless you're an agent of chaos
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. edit values in `config.py` to suit your liking. This might involve a lot of trial and error if you don't know what you're doing, either due to errors from incompatible parameter configurations or from going over your available vRAM amount. Checkout the config files for each already trained model to get an idea of what reasonable values look like
6. Hop into `train.ipynb` and run every cell before the final one. There's a cell where if you set the `if` statement to `True` then you'll be able to visualize what the learning rate is going to look like over the course of training (which you determined over in `config.py`)
7. If you like the look of the model you trained, run that final cell to save it. I recommend going into `trained/` and changing the folder name if you didn't already do so when messing with the config since the default is just going to be the date & time that its training began
8. If you ever want to just test out a model you've already made then hop on over into `inference.ipynb` and run all the cells.
9. If you've trained multiple models, you can compare them in `model_comparison.ipynb` as long as you remember to use the third cell to specify which models you want to compare. It'll look at loss curves over the course of training and teacher-forcing topk accuracy rate
10. This step could really go anywhere, but if you're trying to learn how transformers work then along with reading the code in `modules/` you can use `test_modules.ipynb` to visualize how the tensor shapes change.
11. If/when you become confident to mess with the actual code yourself and test out a novel architecture idea you've got, head on over into `modules/` and get to work. While you're doing this, make sure to use `LoggingModule` instead of `nn.module` and put `@log_io` before every class function you make so that you can use `test_modules.ipynb` for easy visualization/debugging. 
12. If/when you've got a novel transformer architecture edit up and working, send it over to the [micro-GPT-sandbox](https://github.com/evintunador/micro-GPT-sandbox) for easy comparisons against the original templateGPT

## file structure
- `modules/`: where all of the code for the actual model goes
    - `layer.py`: defines each residual connection layer of our GPT
    - `logging.py`: defines the `LoggingModule` class, a wrapper that you should use instead of pytorch's `nn.module` in order to facilitate easy demonstration of how tensor shapes change throughout a given module
    - `mlp.py`: a two-layer multi-layer perceptron with an optional gate and either [ReLU](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.ReLU.html), [GeLU](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.GELU.html), or [SiLU](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.SiLU.html) nonlinearities, all configurable in `config.py`. Adding more nonlinearities is also absurdly easy
    - `model.py`: the primary class for our GPT
    - `attention.py`: [multi-query attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02150) with pre-computed [rotary positional encodings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09864) that knows to automatically use [Flash Attention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention) if you have access to a cuda GPU.
    - `norm.py`: a norm module with an optional affine layer that allows you to switch between [RMSNorm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07467), [LayerNorm](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.LayerNorm.html) and [CosineNorm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.05870) easily using a setting over in `config.py`. Adding different normalization methods is also absurdly easy
- `custom_tokenizers/`: a folder where you store your tokenizers
    - `bpe_tinyStories/`: a [byte-pair encoding](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter6/5) tokenizer trained on the first 10k sequences from the [TinyStoriesV2](https://huggingface.co/datasets/noanabeshima/TinyStoriesV2) dataset, which is a fan-made upgrade over the original [TinyStories](https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories)
        - `build.ipynb`: the notebook where i trained the tokenizer models
        - `tokenizer.py`: an overly-simplistic and annoyingly inefficient tokenizer with bos & eos tokens, post-sequence padding, and a `display` function to help you visualize how a given string is broken down into tokens
        - `models/`
            - `{509, 1021, 2045}.model`: different tokenizer sizes, each a subset of the next. 
    - `bpe_fineweb/`: a yet-to-be trained [byte-pair encoding](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter6/5) tokenizer of [fineweb](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb)
        - ...
    - `bpe_fineweb-edu/`: a [byte-pair encoding](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter6/5) tokenizer trained on the first 2k sequences from the "sample-350BT" subset of [fineweb-edu](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu). We train the model on the "sample-10BT" subset which means the tokenizer was ~mostly~ trained on data the model won't see during training
        - ...
        - `models/`
            - `{509, 1021, 2045, 4093, 8189, 16381, 32765}.model`: different tokenizer sizes, each a subset of the next. 
- `trained/`
    - `templateGPT_?m_?/`: a series of yet-to-be-trained models designed to be compared against one another (assuming the same dataset)
        - `model_config.json`: hyperparameters of the model
        - `model.pth`: weights of the model
        - `train_config.json`: hyperparameters of the training loop used
        - `log_data.csv`: a record of loss and a couple other key metrics over the course of training
- `inference.ipynb`: open this notebook if you just want to see the output of one of the models
- `model_comparison.ipynb`: open this notebook to compare different models against each other. includes loss curve plots and topk teacher-forcing accuracy rate
- `testing_modules.ipynb`: creates easy printouts that allow you to follow the progression of tensor shapes for demonstration & debugging purposes of all the modules in `model.py`. If you're building new modules for a novel architecture idea you have then this notebook will be of extreme value to you in debugging & visualization
- `train.ipynb`: open this notebook to train a new model
- `config.py`: all of the easily editable model and training settings
- `inference.py`: functions for performing inference; used in multiple `.ipynb` files
- `model_comparison.py`: functions for comparing models; used in `model_comparison.ipynb`
- `requirements.txt`: I should probably change this to only include the packages that are actually necessary and not be so strict on versions. The command I used to get this list is `pip freeze | grep -v " @ file://" > requirements.txt` and then I deleted the version numbers, lmk if you know of a better method
- `tools.py`: A variety of functions & classes that don't fit elsewhere and/or are used by more than one of the jupyter notebooks. I should prolly find a better way to organize these
- `train.py`: functions for training a model, used in `train.ipynb`

### potential future TODOs
- [ ] go back and make sure model checkpointing is working. at one point it was but i've changed so much since then and haven't bothered using it so i'd bet it's broken
- [ ] create `hyperparameter_search.ipynb` that knows to cancel a run if it's going over your available vram usage

- [ ] add sparse/local/windowed attention mask options
- [ ] add support for byte-level tokenization
    - should be as simple as adding 259 (= 256 + the 3 special tokens) as a size option and letting any of the regular bpe tokenizers just return those raw bytes

## how to contribute
Other than the above TODO lists, appreciated contributions include:
- bug fixes
- adding more detailed comment explanations of what the code is doing
- general readability edits
- efficiency edits
- editing the code in `modules/` to take better advantage of the `LoggingModule`. This means splitting up each class into more and tinier functions
- training more models (especially if they're bigger than what's already here!)
